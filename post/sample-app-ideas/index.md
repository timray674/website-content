If you're reading this post you are looking for an idea, a simple app that you can use in your tutorial or in your example project to test a new framework or API, but you can't find anything that really resonates with you.

It needs to be simple enough but at the same time complex enough to be worth doing.

> "I don't want to build another to-do app", I hear you thinking.

I wrote this post to help myself, and I hope this will help you as well.

Some of the ideas are self-contained (not involving the use of an external API), some make use of famous public APIs where you can easily grab pre-built data.

Some require a server part, some do not, which might also depend on your implementation.

But I try to keep those ideas:

- good to build a tutorial
- good to experiment with web technologies
- not something that will take a week to figure out
- not "startup ideas"
- I do not target mobile apps but web apps
- easy to explain
- easy to build (less than 24 hours if prepared)
- easy to extend with new features

So, enough talk, here's the list!

## Data for your sample apps

Sometimes you start doing some simple app, but you're bored at finding data you can use. You don't have to, you can use real data, or random data.

### Public APIs you can use in example projects

Maybe you have an idea for a perfectly nice CRUD app, or something that works with an API, but you don't want to create the API in the first place.

I recommend to check out [Airtable](/airtable/), which provides a great API for developers, very easy to use, like a database.

There are amazing public APIs you can use:

- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/docs.html)
- [The Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

### Image placeholders for your sample projects

### Image generators

Avatars:

- [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/)
- [Adorable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io/)

### Sample text generator for your sample projects

Lorem Ipsum is boring. Spice it up:

- [Cat Ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/index.php)

If you insist on using Lorem Ipsum, [Loripsum](https://loripsum.net/) is a good generator.

### Other fake data

[FakeJSON](https://fakejson.com/) has tons of fake data generation capabilities.

[JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) has fake posts, comments, photos, todos, users, albums ready for REST consumption.

Need fake name/user data generation? Check [UI Names](https://github.com/thm/uinames) and [RandomUser](https://randomuser.me/)

## Wrapping up

I hope this list is comprehensive enough to suit your needs!

Have fun!
